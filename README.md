### How to Play 
* Press spacebar to begin 
* Use left and right arrow keys to manuever left and right
* Press spacebar for spinning attack to kill bats

Player must bounce from platfrom to platfrom, continously getting higher with each platfrom bounce, for as long as possible. If player does not land on platform then the game ends. If player moves off to the left or right side of screen they will appear on opposite side of the screen. Use spinning attack to kill bats. If player runs into bats then health bar will decrease by 25%. If health bar hits zero, then the game is over. Player can increase health by 10% by collecting health potions. 

### Features
